        <h1>Find Prime Factors of a number</h1>
        <h3>
            Create a function which takes a number as input and returns all of it's prime factors.

            Hint: A Prime Number is: a whole number greater than 1 that can not be made by multiplying other whole number.<br>
            "Prime Factorization" is finding which prime numbers multiply together to make the original number.
            <br/><br/>
            Ex: 
            <pre>
                findPrimeFactors(12) ➞ [2, 2, 3]
                findPrimeFactors(147) ➞ [3, 7, 7]
                findPrimeFactors(17) ➞ [17]
            </pre>

            // Sol: 1. To get the prime factors of a number. Start dividing the number with the smallest prime number i.e. 2. After the division, if remainder is 0 then that divisor is a prime factor and thus, push it to the output array of prime_factors and then divide the result of division with 2 again.
            // 2. But if remainder is not 0, increase the divisor by 1. (To get to the next prime number)
            // 3. Repeat the loop until divisor is equal to the number
            const findPrimeFactors = num => {
                prime_factors = []; // Array to hold all the prime factors
                divisor = 2; // Start with smallest prime number
                while(divisor <= num) {
                    if(num % divisor === 0) {
                        prime_factors.push(divisor);
                        num = num / divisor;

                    }
