        <h1>How Many Days Between Two Dates</h1>
        <h3>
            Create a function which will take two dates as input and returns the number of days between them
            <br>
            Ex: 
            <pre>
                findDays("January 10, 2020", "January 16, 2020") ➞ 6
                findDays("December 29, 2019", "January 1, 2020") ➞ 3
                findDays("March 1, 2020", "March 2, 2020") ➞ 1
            </pre>
        </h3>
        <script>
            // First convert the string dates to JS Date Object with new Date(), then we can use a simple substraction to get the difference b/w two dates. But that will be returned in milliseconds. Next we need to convert milliseconds into days (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
            const findDays = (date1, date2) => (new Date(date2) - new Date(date1)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)

            console.log(findDays("January 10, 2020", "January 16, 2020"));
            console.log(findDays("December 29, 2019", "January 1, 2020"));
            console.log(findDays("March 1, 2020", "March 2, 2020"));
        </script>
